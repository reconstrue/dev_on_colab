Tools that can do that will be referred to herein as \"binners\" because they sort pixels into bins. This has been considered to be worth the time because of a project involving sets of 2D images which are on the order of 20 to 60 gigabytes (GB) which each image being on the order of 50 MB. That all adds up to some compute time. It is worth knowing how to do that quickly."
